# Build the plugin and symlink main.js/manifest.json/styles.css into a vault's
# .obsidian/plugins/worktrack-pm-compass directory, so future rebuilds are picked up by
# Obsidian without re-copying.
#
# Usage:   scripts/link-plugin.sh [--dev] <vault-path>
# Example: scripts/link-plugin.sh ~/Documents/MyVault
#          scripts/link-plugin.sh --dev ~/Documents/MyVault
#
# Builds the minified bundle a release ships. --dev builds a readable one with an
# inline sourcemap instead. The links outlive the build, so a later `pnpm build:dev`
# or `pnpm dev` swaps what this vault loads without re-running this script.
#
# For a one-off copy that doesn't need the source repo to stick around, use
# update-plugin.sh instead.
