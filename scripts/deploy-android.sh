Build the plugin, deploy it to an Obsidian vault on a connected Android phone, and restart
the app so the changes are live. See the comments at the top of this file for the WebView
debugging workflow.

Usage: deploy-android.sh [options] [<vault-path>]

The vault is the folder containing `.obsidian/`, not the plugin folder. It is required, and
may be given positionally (as in link-plugin.sh), with --vault, or as $OBSIDIAN_VAULT.
Options may appear before or after the vault path.

  -v, --vault PATH   Vault to deploy into; same as passing it positionally.
  -s, --shot FILE    Write a screenshot of the running app to FILE.
  -d, --dev          Deploy a readable bundle with an inline sourcemap, rather than the
                     minified one a release ships. Use it to debug; it is ~8x larger.
  -l, --list         List the vaults that already have the plugin installed, then exit.
  -h, --help         Show this message.

Examples:
  ./scripts/deploy-android.sh --list
  ./scripts/deploy-android.sh /sdcard/MyVault
  ./scripts/deploy-android.sh --dev /sdcard/MyVault
  ./scripts/deploy-android.sh --shot /tmp/after.png /sdcard/MyVault

# Lists the vaults on the device that already have worktrack-pm-compass installed.
#
# Matching on the plugin folder rather than on `.obsidian/` alone is what makes the output
# actionable: deploying needs an existing plugin directory (see the $DEST check below), so a
# vault without one is not somewhere this script can deploy, and listing it only invites
# picking it. A vault you want to add the plugin to for the first time needs the folder
# created by hand (or by installing the plugin once through Obsidian).
#
# `find -L` is required, not a nicety: /sdcard is a symlink to the real storage mount, and
# find won't descend through it without -L (`find /sdcard` returns only "/sdcard" itself).
# The device shell is mksh, which has no globstar, so `**` is not an option for this.
#
# Depth is capped only to stop the search running away on a large /sdcard; it is set deep
# enough to find nested vaults, which costs a few seconds and is worth it. The +3 keeps
# $VAULT_SEARCH_DEPTH meaning the vault's own depth, since the match now sits three levels
# below it (.obsidian/plugins/<id>). Vault-shaped junk is pruned: sync tools and Obsidian
# itself keep backup copies that contain a `.obsidian/` but are not vaults you want to
