# Example: scripts/update-plugin.sh ~/Documents/MyVault

# Copies the minified bundle a release ships. --dev copies a readable one with an
# inline sourcemap instead, for when a stack trace out of that vault has to mean
# something.
#
# For iterative local development, prefer link-plugin.sh instead — it symlinks
# the built files so you don't need to re-run this after every change.
